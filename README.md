## My process

I layed out all the HTML files first, along with custom fonts from Google. I styled the page with CSS and then linked it back to the HTML file.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a lot from this project. My favorite addition to this project was the footer section where I was able to add my own name to my work.

```html
<footer class="attribution">

    Coded by <a href="#">Jose Juarez</a>.
  </footer>
